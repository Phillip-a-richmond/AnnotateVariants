As of September 2020, the VCFAnno config will expect a specific directory structure.

The structure is simple:

Assume a starting point given to VCFAnno of /mnt/common/DATABASES/REFERENCES/<GENOME_VERSION>/

Databases inside this directory contain files relevant to a specific coordinate system.

Inside of this path will be subdirectories containing different databases, sometimes split by version.
