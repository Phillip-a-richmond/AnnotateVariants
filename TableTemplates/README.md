# Table Templates

> This directory contains template CVL excel files. 

## Changelog
- September 10th 2018: Bhavi added new table template that matches to latest gemini query script, with PrimateAI and het/homo for general damaging variants
- January 2019: the front page of the table contained all variants from one CVL.tsv of the part, pasted out of sight. Robin removed those lines. Typo in tab name: X Autosomal Dominant => X Dominant
