# Gemini Query Scripts

> This directory is for the query scripts used on the GEMINI databases. 

The purpose of these scripts is to generate a candidate variant list (CVL), which contains variant statistics alongside candidate variants that may underlie the causes of genetic disease.

## Usage
Copy the script to your destination, edit the header to match your case (working directory, family identifier), and then execute with:

"""
sh GeminiQueries.sh
"""
