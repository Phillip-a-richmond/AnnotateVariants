It contains two transmembrane helices and localizes to the mitochondrial membrane. Mutations in this gene can cause mitochondrial complex IV deficiency, which results in ataxia and muscle hypotonia. There are multiple pseudogenes for this gene. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2015]

The encoded protein also contains fibronectin type III repeats and an epidermal growth factor repeat. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate the mature receptor, which likely plays roles in endocytosis and sorting. Mutations in this gene may be associated with Alzheimer&apos;s disease. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]
